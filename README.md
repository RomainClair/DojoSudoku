# Sudoku Dojo

The goal of this Dojo is the validation of a sudoku grid.

To do that :

* Complete the SudokuGrid::isInvalid() method to tell if the grid contains more than one time each value (1 to 9 there could be more than one 0 on a valid grid) on any line, column.
* *Optionnal* : a grid is also invalid when a value is present at least twice in a 3*3 square.
* You can test your class by running ```$php sudokuTest.php``` or ```$php sudokuTest.php --with-square``` fot the optionnal part
